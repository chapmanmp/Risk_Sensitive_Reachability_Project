\begin{abstract}
A classic reachability problem for safety of dynamic systems is to compute the set of initial states from which 
the state trajectory is guaranteed to stay inside a given constraint set over some time horizon. 
In this paper, we leverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures 
to formulate a \textit{risk-sensitive} reachability problem for safety of stochastic dynamic systems under non-adversarial disturbances
over a finite time horizon.
We provide two key contributions to the reachability literature. 
First, our formulation quantifies the distance between the boundary of the constraint set and the state trajectory for a stochastic dynamic system.
In the literature, Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability methods quantify this distance for non-deterministic systems subject to adversarial disturbances, while
stochastic reachability methods reduce the distance to a binary random variable in order to quantify the probability of safety. 
Second, our formulation accounts for rare high-consequence events by posing the optimal control problem in terms of a risk measure, 
called \textit{Conditional Value-at-Risk} (CVaR).
HJ reachability assumes that high-consequence events occur always, which may yield overly conservative solutions in practice,
whereas stochastic reachability does not explicitly account for rare high-consequence events,
since the optimal control problem is posed in terms of the expectation operator.
We define a \textit{risk-sensitive safe set} as the set of initial states from which the risk of extreme constraint violations
can be made small via an appropriate control policy, where risk is quantified using CVaR.
We show that certain risk-sensitive safe sets enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees.
We provide a dynamic programming algorithm to compute under-approximations of risk-sensitive safe sets
and prove the correctness of the algorithm for finite probability spaces.
Our proof is a novel contribution, as it does not require the assumption of strong duality, which was required in a previous paper.

\section{Introduction}
Reachability analysis is a formal verification method based on optimal control theory that is used to prove 
safety or performance properties of dynamic systems~\cite{bansal2017hamilton}.
A classic reachability problem for safety is to compute the set of initial states from which 
the state trajectory is guaranteed to stay inside a given constraint set over some time horizon.
This problem was first considered for discrete-time dynamic systems by Bertsekas and Rhodes 
under the assumption that disturbances are uncertain but belong to known sets~\cite{bertsekas1971control},~\cite{bertsekas1971minimax},~\cite{bertsekas2005dynamic}.
In this context, the problem is solved using a minimax formulation,
in which disturbances behave adversarially and safety is described as a binary notion based on set membership~\cite{bertsekas1971control},~\cite{bertsekas1971minimax},~\cite{bertsekas2005dynamic}.\footnotemark 
\footnotetext{in ref.~\cite{bertsekas2005dynamic}, see Sec. 3.6.2, ``Control within a Target Tube"}

In practice, minimax formulations can yield overly conservative solutions, particularly because disturbances are not often adversarial.
Most storms do not cause major floods, and most vehicles are not involved in pursuit-evader games.
If there are enough observations of the system, one can estimate a probability distribution
for the disturbance, and then assess safety properties of the system in a more realistic context.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{Ref.~\cite{silverman2018density} presents methods for estimating probability distributions.} 
For stochastic discrete-time dynamic systems, %Assuming that a probabilistic discrete-time dynamics model is available, 
Abate et al. developed an algorithm that computes the set of initial states
from which the probability of safety of the state trajectory can be made large by an appropriate control policy~\cite{abate2008probabilistic}.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{Safety of the state trajectory is the event that the state trajectory stays in the constraint set over a finite time horizon.} 
Summers and Lygeros extended the algorithm of Abate et al. to quantify the probability of safety and performance
of the state trajectory, by specifying that the state trajectory should also reach a target set~\cite{summers2010verification}.   

Both the stochastic reachability methods~\cite{abate2008probabilistic},~\cite{summers2010verification} and the minimax reachability methods~\cite{bertsekas1971control},~\cite{bertsekas1971minimax},~\cite{bertsekas2005dynamic} for discrete-time dynamic systems
describe safety as a binary notion based on set membership.
In Abate et al., for example, the probability of safety to be optimized is the expectation of the product (or maximum)
of indicator functions, where each indicator encodes the event that the state at a particular time point is inside a given set~\cite{abate2008probabilistic}.
The stochastic reachability methods~\cite{abate2008probabilistic},~\cite{summers2010verification} 
do not generalize to quantify the random distance between the state trajectory and the boundary of the constraint set,
since they use indicator functions to convert probabilities to expectations to be optimized.

In contrast, Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability methods quantify the deterministic analogue of this distance
for continuous-time systems subject to adversarial disturbances 
(e.g., see~\cite{bansal2017hamilton},~\cite{herbert2017fastrack},~\cite{EECS-2018-41},~\cite{mitchell2005toolbox}).
Quantifying the distance between the state trajectory and the boundary of the constraint set in a non-binary fashion
may be important in applications where the boundary is not known exactly,
or where mild constraint violations are inevitable, but extreme constraint violations must be avoided.

It is imperative that reachability methods for safety take into account the possibility that rare events can occur
with potentially damaging consequences. 
Reachability methods that assume adversarial disturbances (e.g.,~\cite{bansal2017hamilton},~\cite{bertsekas1971minimax}) suppose that harmful events can always occur,
which may yield solutions with limited practical utility, especially in applications with large uncertainty sets.
Stochastic reachability methods~\cite{abate2008probabilistic},~\cite{summers2010verification} do not explicitly account for rare high-consequence events
because the optimal control problem is expressed as an expectation. 

In contrast, we leverage existing results on \textit{risk measures} to formulate an optimal control problem
that explicitly encodes a realistic viewpoint on the possibility of rare high-consequence events: 
harmful events are likely to occur at some point, but they are unlikely to occur always.
A \textit{risk measure} is a function that maps a random variable, $Z$, representing loss into the real line,
according to the risk associated with $Z$ (see~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}, Sec. 6.3; see~\cite{kisiala2015conditional}, Sec. 2.2).
Risk-sensitive optimization
is being studied in applied mathematics~\cite{ruszczynski2010risk}, reinforcement learning~\cite{osogami2012robustness},~\cite{chow2015risk},~\cite{ratliff2017risk}, and optimal control~\cite{chow2014framework}.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{In risk-sensitive optimization, the risk of a cost is minimized, where risk is quantified using a risk measure.
Conversely, in stochastic optimization, we usually minimize the expected value of a cost.} 
Risk-sensitive formulations have the potential to inform practical decision-making that also protects
against damaging outcomes~\cite{serraino2013conditional}, where the level of conservatism can be modified as needed.
%~\cite{serraino2013conditional} says "Cvar protects against outcomes that hurt the most", do i need citation in the sentence above?

We use a particular risk measure, called \textit{Conditional Value-at-Risk} (CVaR), in this paper.
If $Z$ is a random cost with finite expectation, then the Conditional Value-of-Risk of $Z$ at confidence level $\alpha \in (0,1)$
is, 
\begin{equation}
\text{CVaR}_\alpha[Z] = {\underset{t \in \mathbb{R}}\min} \text{ }\Big\{ t + \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-t,0\}\big] \Big\};
\label{cvareqn}
\end{equation}
see~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}, Equation 6.22.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{Conditional Value-at-Risk is also called \textit{Average Value-at-Risk}, which is abbreviated as AV@R in~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}.}
Note that $\text{CVaR}_\alpha[Z]$ increases from $\mathbb{E}[Z]$ to $\sup Z$, as $\alpha$ decreases from 1 to 0.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{Technically, $\text{CVaR}_\alpha[Z] \rightarrow \text{ess}\sup Z$ as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$, 
where $\text{ess}\sup Z$ is the \textit{essential supremum} of $Z$. Informally, essential supremum is a supremum for random variables.}
Further, there is a well-established relationship between CVaR and chance constraints
that we use to obtain probabilistic safety guarantees. 
Chow et al. provides tractable methods to compute the CVaR of a cumulative cost
incurred by a Markov Decision Process~\cite{chow2015risk} that we also leverage.
CVaR has additional desirable properties that are of particular interest to researchers in financial risk management and are summarized in ref.~\cite{serraino2013conditional}. 

The key contributions of this paper follow.
We formulate a risk-sensitive reachability problem for safety of stochastic dynamic systems under non-adversarial disturbances
over a finite time horizon. In particular, our formulation quantifies the non-binary distance between the boundary of the constraint set and the
state trajectory for a stochastic dynamic system. This is an extension of stochastic 
reachability methods (e.g.,~\cite{abate2008probabilistic},~\cite{summers2010verification}), which reduce this distance to a binary random variable.
Further, in contrast to stochastic reachability methods, our formulation explicitly accounts for rare high-consequence events by posing the optimal control problem
in terms of Conditional Value-at-Risk instead of expectation. This is the first use of risk measures in the reachability literature to our knowledge.
In Sec.~\ref{problem}, we define the notion of a \textit{risk-sensitive safe set} and formalize the problem statement.
Sec.~\ref{prop} summarizes properties of risk-sensitive safe sets, including their relation to probabilistic safety.
Sec.~\ref{alg} provides a dynamic programming algorithm to compute under-approximations of risk-sensitive safe sets. %include proof?

\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem}
We consider a stochastic discrete-time dynamic system over a finite time horizon,\footnotemark
\footnotetext{The system model is a special case of the model given by~\cite{bertsekas2005dynamic} in Sec. 1.2.}
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = f(x_k,u_k,w_k), \text{ }\text{ } k = 0, 1, \dots, N-1,
\label{sys}\end{equation}
such that $x_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state of the system at time $k$,
$u_k \in U$ is the control at time $k$, and
$w_k \in D$ is the random disturbance at time $k$. Both $U$ and $D$ are finite sets.
$\mathbb{P}[w_k = d_j] = p_j$ 
is the probability that the disturbance has the value $d_j \in D$ at time $k$, where $0 \leq p_j \leq 1$ and $\sum_{j=1}^W p_j = 1$.\footnotemark
\footnotetext{We also assume that $w_k$ is independent of $x_k$, $u_k$, and disturbances at any other times.}  
We assume that the initial condition, $x_0$, is not random.
We are given a (non-empty) constraint set, $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and the safety criterion that 
the state of the system should stay inside $\mathcal{K}$ over time. 
For example, if the system is a pond with an outlet, then $x_k$ may be the water level at time $k$,
$u_k$ may  suppose that our system is a pond with an outlet. if our system is a pond with an outlet

The collection of admissible control policies is,
\begin{equation}
\Pi = \{ (\mu_0, \mu_1, \dots, \mu_{T-1}), \text{ such that } \mu_k: S\rightarrow C \}.
\end{equation}



For example, if our application is the flow of water through a network of ponds and streams, 
$\mathcal{K}$ may indicate that the water does not overflow the banks during a storm event.

\section{Problem Statement}
The goal of this paper is to design an algorithm that computes a \textit{risk-sensitive safe set} 
for a system of the form specified in Sec.~\ref{model}.
A risk-sensitive safe set is, informally, the set of initial conditions of the system, from which there is small risk of large constraint violations over time.

We quantify risk using the well-established risk measure, \textit{Conditional Value-at-Risk} (CVaR), which is equal to,
\begin{equation}
\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z) = {\underset{c \in \mathbb{R}}\min} \text{ }\Big\{ c + \frac{1}{\delta}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-c,0\}\big] \Big\},
\label{cvareqn}
\end{equation}
where $\delta \in (0,1)$, and $Z$ is a random variable representing loss~\cite{rockafellar2000optimization}.\footnotemark

If $Z$ is a continuous random variable, then $\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z)$ is the expected value of $Z$ over large realizations of $Z$,
where the meaning of large is based on $\delta$ (Fig.~\ref{cvar}).

\begin{figure}[thpb]

      \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{cvar.jpg}
      \caption{An illustration of $\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z) \in \mathbb{R}$, if $Z$ is a continuous random variable. 
	  The graph shows the probability density function of $Z$ versus the realizations of $Z$.
	  The area of the right portion under the curve, shown in red, is $\delta \in (0,1)$.	  
	  The area of the left portion under the curve, shown in grey, is $1-\delta$.
	  $\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z)$ is the expectation of the values along the right portion under the curve, indicated by a yellow circle.}
      \label{cvar}
\end{figure}

We quantify the extent of constraint violation via a surface function that characterizes the constraint set, $\mathcal{K}$.
Let $g: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfy,
\begin{equation}
x \in \mathcal{K} \iff g(x) < 0,
\label{g}
\end{equation}
where we adopt the convention provided by~\cite{EECS-2018-41} in Eq. (2.3). 
The particular form of $g$ is chosen based on how safety of the system changes with distance to the boundary of $\mathcal{K}$ for the application at hand.
For example, if the relationship between safety and distance to the boundary of $\mathcal{K}$ is linear, 
then the signed distance function for $\mathcal{K}$ is a suitable choice for $g$ (Fig.~\ref{exg}, dotted).
However, if the relationship between safety and distance to the boundary of $\mathcal{K}$ is non-linear,
then a quadratic function may be more appropriate (Fig.~\ref{exg}, solid).

\begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{examples_of_g.jpg}
      \caption{Different choices for the particular form of $g$, see~\eqref{g}, for an example constraint set, $\mathcal{K} = (0, 10)$. The relationship between
		safety and distance to the boundary of $\mathcal{K}$ is linear for $g_1(x) = |x-5|-5$ (dotted), and non-linear for $g_2(x) = x(x-10)$ (solid).
		For example, the degree of safety at $x=6$ characterized by the linear relationship is, $g_1(6) = -4$, since the closest distance 
		from $x=6$ to the boundary of $\mathcal{K}$ is 4, and $x=6$ is inside $\mathcal{K}$.}
      \label{exg}
\end{figure}

We are now ready to define the risk-sensitive safe set formally.
Let $\xi_y^\pi(k) \in S$ be the random state of the system at time $k$ that satisfies~\eqref{sys} under a given control policy $\pi \in \Pi$,
starting from a given (non-random) state $y \in S$ at time 0.  
The maximum extent of constraint violation attained by the system under policy $\pi \in \Pi$, starting from initial condition $y \in S$, 
is given by the random variable,
\begin{equation}
X_y^\pi = {\underset{k \in \{0, \dots, T\}}\max} \Big\{ g\big(\xi_y^\pi(k)\big) \Big\},
\label{xpiy}\end{equation}
where $g$ satisfies~\eqref{g}.
For any $\delta \in (0,1)$, the risk-sensitive safe set is,
\begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
\mathcal{U}_\delta := &  \Big\{y \in S\text{ }|\text{ }\exists \pi \in \Pi \text{ such that } \text{CVaR}_\delta\left(X_y^\pi\right) < 0 \Big\} \\
= & \Big\{y \in S \text{ }|\text{ } {\underset{\pi \in \Pi}\min}\text{ } \big\{\text{CVaR}_\delta\left(X_y^\pi\right)\big\} < 0 \Big\},
\label{U}\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where the random variable, $X_y^\pi$, is defined in~\eqref{xpiy},
and the conditional value-at-risk is taken with respect to the probability distribution of $(w_0, \dots, w_{T-1})$. 
To summarize, the risk-sensitive safe set is the set of initial conditions from which
the risk of large constraint violations can be made small by an appropriate control policy.
The problem addressed in this paper is how to compute~\eqref{U}.

\section{Properties of $\mathcal{U}_\delta$}
Here we present two key properties of the risk-sensitive safe set.
The first property is that every state in $\mathcal{U}_\delta$ enjoys a probabilistic safety guarantee.
To prove this property, we need the following result adopted from~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}.\\
\textcolor{blue}{SJ: The simplified proof is using $\delta = 1 - \alpha$. I suggest we use this notation throughout the paper. }\\
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma1}
 Let $\delta \in (0,1)$, and $Z$ be a random variable. If $\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z) < 0$, then $\mathbb{P}[Z\geq 0] < \delta$ (see~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}, Sec. 6.2.4).\footnotemark
\end{lemma}
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{proof} SJ: simplifying the proof below. 
\begin{align}
& \text{CVaR}_{1-\alpha}(Z) < 0 \nonumber \\ 
\iff & \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-c,0\}\big] < -c \nonumber \\
\iff & \exists c \in \mathbb{R} \;\; c + \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-c,0\}\big] < 0 \; [\text{using }~\eqref{cvareqn}] \nonumber \\
\iff & \mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-c,0\}\big] < -c(1-\alpha) \label{proofeqn1}
\end{align} 
Now, the LHS of the inequality,  $\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z-c,0\}\big] \geq 0$ because the expectation of non-negative values cannot be negative. Consequently, the RHS of the inequality must also be non-negative, that is, $-c(1-\alpha) \geq 0$, that is, $c \leq 0$ since $1-\alpha \geq 0$. So, we can rewrite  inequality~\eqref{proofeqn1} using $ a = -c \geq 0$ as follows: 
\begin{align}
& \mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\}\big] < a(1-\alpha), \; \text{where} \; a \geq 0 \nonumber \\
\iff & \; \frac{1}{a}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\}\big] < 1-\alpha, \; \text{where}  \; a \geq 0 \label{proofeqn2}
\end{align}
Using Markov's Inequality,
$\mathbb{P}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a \big] \leq  \frac{1}{a}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\}\big]$. Combining with inequality~\eqref{proofeqn2},\\
\begin{align}
& \mathbb{P}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a \big] \leq  \frac{1}{a}\mathbb{E}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\}\big] < 1-\alpha \nonumber \\
\Rightarrow \;\; & \mathbb{P}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a \big] < 1-\alpha \label{proofeqn3}
\end{align}
Now, $Z \geq 0 \iff Z+a \geq a \iff \max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a $ since $a \geq 0$, and so,\\
$\mathbb{P}\big[Z \geq 0\big] = \mathbb{P}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a\big]$.
Combining with the inequality~\eqref{proofeqn3},
\begin{align*}
& \mathbb{P}\big[Z \geq 0\big] = \mathbb{P}\big[\max\{Z+a,0\} \geq a\big] < 1-\alpha \\
\iff \;\; & \mathbb{P}\big[Z \geq 0\big] < 1-\alpha 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
The only one-sided implication is in the use of Markov's Inequality to get inequality~\eqref{proofeqn2}, and this corresponds to the approximation gap in using 
 $\text{CVaR}_{1-\alpha}(Z) < 0$
 to approximate $\mathbb{P}[Z\geq 0] < 1-\alpha$.\\}
%% sj: end new proof
\footnotetext{Ref.~\cite{shapiro2009lectures} indicates that the constraint, $\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z) \leq 0$, gives a conservative approximation of the chance constraint, $\mathbb{P}[Z > 0] \leq \delta$. %pp. 257-258 
$\text{CVaR}_\delta(Z) \leq 0$ is written as ``$\text{AV@R}_\alpha(Z_x) \leq 0$'' in~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}, see (6.24).
$\mathbb{P}[ Z > 0] \leq \delta$ is equivalent to $\mathbb{P}[ Z\leq 0] \geq 1 - \delta$, 
which is written as ``$\text{Pr}(Z_x \leq 0) \geq 1 - \alpha$" in~\cite{shapiro2009lectures}, see text below (6.18).}
The next corollary indicates that every state in $\mathcal{U}_\delta$ enjoys a probabilistic safety guarantee.
\begin{corollary}
$\mathcal{U}_\delta$, as defined in~\eqref{U}, is a subset of $\mathcal{S}_\delta$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S}_\delta := \Big\{y \in S\text{ }|\text{ }\exists \pi \in \Pi\text{, } \mathbb{P}\left[\forall k \in \mathbb{T}\text{, }\xi_y^\pi(k) \in \mathcal{K} \right]  > 1-\delta \Big\}, \\
\label{S}\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{P}$ is the probability measure for the state trajectory, and $\mathbb{T} = \{0, 1, \dots, T\}$ is the time horizon.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
\textcolor{blue}{may want to remove this proof b/c it's not very important?}
Take $y \in \mathcal{U}_\delta$. Then, there exists $\pi \in \Pi$ such that $\text{CVaR}_\delta(X_y^\pi) < 0$, 
which implies $\mathbb{P}[X_y^\pi \geq 0] < \delta$ by Lemma~\ref{lemma1}.
After some algrebra using~\eqref{g} and~\eqref{xpiy},
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}[X_y^\pi \geq 0] = 1 - \mathbb{P}\left[\forall k \in \mathbb{T}\text{, } \xi_y^\pi(k) \in \mathcal{K} \right].
\end{equation}
So, $\exists \pi \in \Pi$ such that $\mathbb{P}\left[\forall k \in \mathbb{T}\text{, } \xi_y^\pi(k) \in \mathcal{K} \right] > 1- \delta$, implying that $y \in \mathcal{S}_\delta$.
\end{proof}
The second key property of the risk-sensitive safe set, $\mathcal{U}_\delta$, is, as $\delta$ decreases,
the states of $\mathcal{U}_\delta$ enjoy a stronger probabilistic safety guarantee, and $\mathcal{U}_\delta$ becomes smaller.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma2}
Let $1>\delta_1 \geq \delta_2>0$. Then, $\mathcal{S}_{\delta_2} \supset \mathcal{S}_{\delta_1}$,
and $\mathcal{U}_{\delta_2} \supset \mathcal{U}_{\delta_1}$, where $\mathcal{U}_{\delta}$ is given by~\eqref{U}
and $\mathcal{S}_{\delta}$ is given by~\eqref{S}. 
\end{lemma}

\section{Relation between Probablistic Safety and CVaR safety}\label{lemmaconnection}







\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
-inform the cost-effective design of infrastructure that must withstand rare extreme storms,
-possible other applications: to reduce overly conservative error bounds that arise in safe dynamic motion planning (e.g.,~\cite{herbert2017fastrack}), 
and to increase the amount of time that an autonomous vehicle can operate safely while simultaneously optimizing for performance.

%every state contained in the risk-sensitive safe set that we will define enjoys a probabilistic safety guarantee, to be discussed in Sec.~\ref{lemmaconnection}. 
%We are interested in developing a framework for risk-sensitive reachability theory to inform decision-making in an uncertain world, where it may not be sensible to ensure safety by assuming worst-case circumstances.
% Want to quantify varying degrees of safety in a way that realistically (rather than pessimistically) appreciates/prepares for low-probability extreme events through the use of a financial risk measure (i.e., a ``robustified" expected value).

%\section*{APPENDIX}\label{appendix}

\addtolength{\textheight}{-2cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
